# Complete Reality Grid Supabase Implementation

## 🎯 Overview
This implementation moves ALL game logic into Supabase using PostgreSQL functions, eliminating the need for complex ETL scripts and ensuring consistent performance.

## 📋 Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. Create Complete Database Schema
Go to your **Supabase SQL Editor** and run the entire contents of:
```
/supabase/realitygrid-complete-schema.sql
```

This creates:
- ✅ All tables with proper constraints and indexes  
- ✅ Views for efficient querying
- ✅ Functions for eligibility, validation, typeahead, and puzzle generation
- ✅ Row Level Security policies

### 2. Load Data (ETL)
```bash
# Load Bravo shows and cast data
npm run etl:bravo

# The rest is now handled by Supabase functions!
```

### 3. Run Supabase Tasks (All-in-One)
```bash
# This runs all T1-T8 tasks automatically
npm run supabase:tasks
```

This single command:
- ✅ Verifies schema exists
- ✅ Derives eligibility (≥3 shows)
- ✅ Identifies candidate shows
- ✅ Generates today's puzzle  
- ✅ Tests validation and typeahead
- ✅ Displays results

### 4. Test the Implementation
```bash
# Test individual components
npm run verify:schema

# Or manually run queries in Supabase using:
# /supabase/testing-queries.sql
```

## 🔧 Key Supabase Functions

### Core Game Functions
```sql
-- Generate daily puzzle (T4)
SELECT rg_generate_daily_puzzle();

-- Validate player guess (T5)
SELECT rg_is_valid_cell_answer(person_id, row_show_id, col_show_id);

-- Search for people (T6)  
SELECT * FROM rg_people_typeahead('search_term');

-- Refresh eligibility (T2)
SELECT rg_derive_eligibility();
```

### Data Analysis Functions
```sql
-- Get shows with eligible people (T3)
SELECT * FROM rg_shows_with_eligible_count();

-- Check intersections between shows
SELECT rg_show_intersection_count(show1_id, show2_id);
```

## 🎮 Updated API Endpoints

The new Supabase-powered endpoints are more efficient:

### GET `/api/realitygrid/typeahead-v2?q=search`
Uses `rg_people_typeahead()` function directly.

### POST `/api/realitygrid/validate-v2`
Uses `rg_is_valid_cell_answer()` function directly.

### GET `/api/realitygrid/puzzle/today` 
Already uses Supabase tables (no changes needed).

## 🔍 Testing & Validation

### Manual Testing in Supabase
1. Go to your SQL Editor
2. Run queries from `/supabase/testing-queries.sql`
3. Verify all functions return expected results

### Automated Testing
```bash
npm run supabase:tasks
```

Expected output:
```
✅ Schema exists (60 shows in database)
✅ Eligibility updated: 347/3425 people eligible (≥3 shows)
✅ Found 52 shows with eligible people
✅ Generated puzzle: uuid-here
✅ Typeahead search 'and': 8 results
✅ Validation test: Person Name in cell (0,0) = true/false
```

## 🎯 Benefits of This Implementation

### Performance
- ⚡ All logic runs in PostgreSQL (single round-trip)
- ⚡ Indexed queries for fast typeahead
- ⚡ Pre-calculated puzzle cells with answer counts

### Reliability  
- 🔒 Server-side validation prevents cheating
- 🔒 Deterministic puzzle generation 
- 🔒 Row Level Security for data access

### Maintainability
- 🧹 Single source of truth in Supabase
- 🧹 No complex ETL dependencies
- 🧹 Easy to test and debug with SQL

## 🚧 Troubleshooting

### "Function does not exist"
- Run the complete schema SQL in Supabase
- Check that functions were created successfully

### "Not enough candidate shows"
- Ensure ETL ran successfully (`npm run etl:bravo`)
- Run eligibility refresh: `SELECT rg_derive_eligibility();`

### Empty puzzle cells
- Check that shows have eligible people
- Verify intersection counts with testing queries

## 🎉 Success Criteria

After setup, you should have:
- ✅ ~60 Bravo shows in database
- ✅ ~3400 people with eligibility calculated  
- ✅ ~350 eligible people (≥3 shows)
- ✅ Daily puzzle with valid 3×3 grid
- ✅ All API endpoints working
- ✅ Fast typeahead search
- ✅ Server-side answer validation

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **UI Implementation**: Build React components using the stable API
2. **Caching**: Add edge caching for `/puzzle/today`
3. **Analytics**: Track game statistics
4. **Scheduling**: Automate daily puzzle generation with Supabase Edge Functions

The entire game logic now lives in Supabase, making it fast, reliable, and easy to maintain! 🎮
