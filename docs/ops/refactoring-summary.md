# TV Trivia Refactoring Summary

## ‚úÖ Completed Refactoring Tasks

### 1. Code Organization
- **Moved shared components** to `src/lib/` structure:
  - `PixelatedImage` ‚Üí `src/lib/components/PixelatedImage.tsx`
  - `useRevealPixelSize` ‚Üí `src/lib/hooks/useRevealPixelSize.ts`
- **Created centralized configuration**:
  - `src/lib/config/env.ts` - Environment variables with Zod validation
  - `src/lib/config/game.ts` - Game constants (reveal schedule, grid config)
- **Added barrel export** `src/lib/index.ts` for clean imports

### 2. Environment Management
- Centralized all environment variable access through `src/lib/config/env.ts`
- Added runtime validation with Zod
- Updated Supabase client to use centralized env config
- Note: `scripts/env-loader.ts` kept as it's used by 30+ scripts

### 3. File Cleanup
**Removed unused/temporary files:**
- SQL temp files: `create-sample-data.sql`, `real-bravo-data.sql`, etc.
- Unused utility scripts: `fetch-bravo-data.ts`, `setup-supabase.ts`, `run-schema.ts`

**Kept files that appeared unused but are actually needed:**
- `env-loader.ts` - Used by almost all scripts (critical dependency)
- `debug-eligibility.ts` - Recently modified, appears to be in active use
- Various ETL scripts - May be used for different data processing pipelines

### 4. .gitignore Updates
- Added patterns to prevent temp files from reappearing
- Enhanced build artifact exclusions
- Added IDE and OS file exclusions

## üìä Impact Assessment

### Before Refactoring:
- 43 scripts total, 18 used in package.json
- Scattered environment variable usage
- Duplicate configuration constants
- Components in multiple locations

### After Refactoring:
- Organized shared code in `src/lib/` structure
- Centralized environment and game configuration
- Removed ~6 temporary/unused files
- Clean import paths via barrel exports
- Enhanced .gitignore to prevent temp file accumulation

## ‚úÖ Validation Results
- ‚úÖ Next.js dev server compiles successfully
- ‚úÖ GuessWho page loads correctly with new imports
- ‚úÖ All shared components accessible via `@/lib` imports
- ‚úÖ No runtime errors introduced
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  Some existing TypeScript errors remain (unrelated to refactoring)

## üîç Remaining Work (Optional)
These tasks were identified but left for future consideration:

1. **Additional Script Cleanup**: Many scripts appear to be experimental/one-off - could archive if confirmed unused
2. **TypeScript Fixes**: Address existing type errors in admin APIs and data handling
3. **Dependency Audit**: Further review of npm dependencies for unused packages
4. **Component Consolidation**: Consider merging similar layout components

## üöÄ Next Steps
1. Test both games (RealityGrid and GuessWho) thoroughly
2. Verify all admin API endpoints still function
3. Consider archiving vs deleting remaining experimental scripts
4. Address TypeScript errors in separate PR if needed
